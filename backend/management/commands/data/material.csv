Physics of Electricity,"Electric charge is a property of certain subatomic particles. Electric charge is quantized in nature. There are two types of electric charges: positive and negative."
Physics of Electricity,"The law of conservation of charge states that the total electric charge in an isolated system remains constant."
Physics of Electricity,"Coulomb's law describes the electrostatic force between charged objects. The force is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them."
Physics of Electricity,"Electric field is a vector field that represents the force exerted per unit charge at any point in space. It is created by electric charges and described by Coulomb's law."
Physics of Electricity,"Electric potential (or voltage) is the amount of electric potential energy per unit charge at a point in an electric field. It is measured in volts."
Physics of Electricity,"Current is the flow of electric charge. It is measured in amperes (A). Direct current (DC) flows in one direction, while alternating current (AC) changes direction periodically."
Physics of Electricity,"Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, and inversely proportional to the resistance between them. The formula is I = V/R."
Physics of Electricity,"Resistance is a measure of the opposition to the flow of electric current. It is measured in ohms (Î©). Resistors are components that provide a specific resistance in an electric circuit."
Physics of Electricity,"Capacitance is the ability of a system to store an electric charge. It is measured in farads (F). A capacitor is a device that stores electric charge and energy in the electric field between a pair of conductors."
Physics of Electricity,"The power of an electric circuit is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt (W). The power formula is P = VI, where P is power, V is voltage, and I is current."
